INTRODUCTION:
This project aims to estimate the human population of high-altitude villages using satellite remote sensing and modeling techniques. Human population estimation is a critical aspect of socioeconomic planning and development. However, this task is particularly challenging in high-altitude villages, where the rugged terrain and harsh climate make traditional methods of data collection difficult. In recent years, remote sensing and modeling techniques have emerged as powerful tools for estimating population density in remote and inaccessible areas. In this project, Iaim to use satellite remote sensing and modeling to estimate the human population of high-altitude villages. The results of this study will not only improve our understanding of the demographic patterns in these areas but will also provide critical information for planning and development initiatives.
The analysis was conducted in four stages -
  -In the first stage, Icollected data on villages located above 2500 meters. This involved identifying and mapping the location of these villages using various sources of satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS) data.
  -In the second stage, Icalculated the slope and aspect of each village using digital elevation models (DEMs) to understand the topographic characteristics of the area.
  -In the third stage, Iused Dynamic World software to extract village features such as building footprints, roads, and water bodies from high-resolution satellite imagery.
  -Finally, in the fourth stage, Iused this data to build a machine learning model that could accurately estimate the population density of each village based on the extracted features, topographic characteristics, and other relevant data.
By following these stages, Iwere able to develop a comprehensive methodology for estimating the human population of high-altitude villages using satellite remote sensing and modeling techniques.

STUDY AREA:
The high-altitude regions of India, such as Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and other regions with an altitude above 2500m, are characterized by rugged terrain, harsh climate, and unique flora and fauna. Ladakh is a high-altitude desert region located in the northernmost part of India, with an average elevation of 3500 meters. The region is arid, and vegetation is sparse, mainly consisting of shrubs and grasses. Himachal Pradesh, located in the western Himalayas, is known for its picturesque mountain ranges, lush forests, and alpine meadows. Uttarakhand, situated in the central Himalayas, is home to some of India's most sacred rivers, including the Ganges and Yamuna. The region has diverse vegetation, including oak, deodar, and rhododendron forests. Sikkim, located in the eastern Himalayas, is known for its biodiversity and unique mountain ecosystems. The region has a diverse range of vegetation, including alpine meadows, temperate forests, and sub-tropical forests. In all of these regions, remote sensing and modeling techniques can provide critical insights into population density and distribution, which can inform planning and development initiatives in these remote areas.
